# Facebook Ad Blocker

UserScript to remove the following Facebook page elements:
- "Sponsored" posts
- "Suggested for You" posts
- "Sponsored" sidebar block
- Stories block (above status)
- Rooms block (below status)

**NOTE**: I know just enough JavaScript to be dangerous. As such, the code may not be
as efficient and smart as it should be. Use at your own risk.
