# Facebook Ad Blocker

UserScript to optionally remove the following Facebook page elements:
- "Sponsored" posts
- "Suggested for You" posts
- "Sponsored" sidebar block
- "People you may know" block
- Stories block (above status)
- Rooms block (below status)

**NOTE**: I know just enough JavaScript to be dangerous. As such, the code may
not be as efficient and smart as it should be. Use at your own risk.

## Install

Install [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) or supported alternative
in your browser and then click the script link below:

* [Install Facebook Ad Blocker](https://github.com/mynameisneo7/facebook-ad-blocker/raw/master/facebook-ad-blocker.user.js)

## Configuration

Settings to choose which elements to block are available by clicking the gear
(âš™) next to **Your Shortcuts** on the left sidebar of the main page.

## Experimental Features

Facebook employs methods to make finding advertising difficult. Using some
experimental methods, it may be possible to find and remove most ads. This comes
with the possible side effect that the entire page or portions of it may break,
become malformed, or unusable. **Use this feature at your own risk.**
